\title{Generate a time series of simulated asset prices using Gaussian distribution.}
\usage{
generate_continuous_price(mean, sd, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean}{Numeric, the mean percentage change per time period (as a decimal, e.g., 0.01 for 1%).}

\item{sd}{Numeric, the standard deviation of the percentage change per time period (as a decimal, e.g., 0.03 for 3%).}

\item{n}{Integer, the number of time periods to simulate.}
}
\value{
An xts object containing the simulated asset prices for each time period, with identical Open, High, Low, and Close values.
}
\description{
This function generates a time series of asset prices with identical Open, High, Low, and Close values
starting from an initial equity of 100. It uses Gaussian-distributed percentage price changes to simulate the asset price movement.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
