\title{Apply EMA Crossover Buy/Sell Engine with ATR-based Condition}
\usage{
apply_ema_crossover_buysell_engine_continuous_atr(
  stock_data,
  ema_fast_param,
  ema_slow_param,
  atr_multiple,
  atr_lookback = 14,
  lag = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stock_data}{A data frame or xts object containing stock data, must include 'Open' and 'Close' columns.}

\item{ema_fast_param}{Integer specifying the period for the fast EMA.}

\item{ema_slow_param}{Integer specifying the period for the slow EMA.}

\item{atr_multiple}{Numeric specifying the multiple of ATR to add to the last execution price for additional buy signals.}

\item{atr_lookback}{Integer specifying the period to calculate ATR (default 14).}

\item{lag}{Integer specifying the lag for the execution, default is 1.}
}
\value{
An xts object that includes the original stock data augmented with columns: Ema_fast, Ema_slow, Signal, Execution, and Hold.
}
\description{
This function applies an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossover strategy combined with
an Average True Range (ATR) based condition to the given stock data. It generates buy and
sell signals based on EMA crossover and modifies these signals further based on ATR conditions.
The function enhances the stock data with EMA values, signals, and hold states for each trading period.
}
\details{
Signals and Execution:
- Signal {-1, 0, 1} is generated based on EMA crossover and ATR conditions.
- Execution {-1, 0, 1} occurs at the end of time (t) + specified lag.
- Hold {0, 1, 2} indicates the state of the position considering ATR conditions and EMA crossover.
- A buy signal leads to buying at the opening of the next period, and a sell signal leads to selling at the opening of the next period.
- Additional buy signals can increase the Hold state from 1 to 2 based on ATR conditions.
