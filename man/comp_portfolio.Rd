\title{Compute Portfolio using volatility per trade given stock_data, buy_sell_engine.}
\usage{
comp_portfolio(
  stock_data,
  buysell_engine,
  initial_capital,
  cost_per_trade,
  volatility_per_trade
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stock_data}{An xts object containing stock data with OHLC values.
The data must include columns named 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Close'.}

\item{buysell_engine}{An xts object representing buy/sell signals, where 1 indicates a buy
signal, -1 indicates a sell signal, and 0 indicates no action.}

\item{initial_capital}{Numeric, the initial capital amount in the portfolio.}

\item{cost_per_trade}{Numeric, the cost per trade expressed as a proportion of the
trade value (for example, 0.001 for 0.1% per trade).}

\item{volatility_per_trade}{Numeric, the volatility per trade expressed as a
proportion of the trade value, used to determine the volume of each trade.}
}
\value{
A list containing two xts objects: 'transaction_data' and 'portfolio_data'.
        'transaction_data' includes columns for 'Volume', 'Execution_price',
        'Transaction', 'Average_cost', and 'Comission'.
        'portfolio_data' includes columns for 'Value', 'Cash', 'Invested', and 'Holding'.

\description{
This function computes the dynamics of a trading portfolio based on buy/sell signals,
stock data, and various trading parameters. It processes a series of trades as indicated
by a buy/sell signal engine and calculates the portfolio's value, cash position, invested
amount, and holdings over time. The function requires stock data with Open, High, Low,
and Close (OHLC) values and a compatible buy/sell signal engine.
}
\examples{
stock_data <- ... # xts object with OHLC data
buysell_engine <- ... # xts object with buy/sell signals
portfolio_result <- comp_portfolio(stock_data, buysell_engine,
                                  10000, 0.001, 0.02)
