\title{Apply Binary Long-only EMA Crossover Buy/Sell Engine}
\usage{
apply_ema_crossover_buysell_engine(
  stock_data,
  ema_fast_param,
  ema_slow_param,
  lag = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stock_data}{A data frame or xts object containing stock data, must include a 'Close' column.}

\item{ema_fast_param}{Integer specifying the period for the fast EMA.}

\item{ema_slow_param}{Integer specifying the period for the slow EMA.}

\item{lag}{Integer specifying the lag for the Hold state, default is 1.}
}
\value{
An xts object that includes the original stock data augmented with columns: Ema_fast, Ema_slow, Signal, Execution, and Hold.
}
\description{
This function applies an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossover strategy to given stock data.
It calculates fast and slow EMAs based on specified parameters and generates binary long-only buy/sell signals
and hold states. The function augments the stock data with EMA values, signals, and hold states for each trading period.
}
\details{
Signals and Execution:
- Signal {-1, 0, 1} is generated at the end of time (t) based on EMA crossover.
- Execution {-1, 0, 1} occurs at the end of time (t) + specified lag.
- Hold {1, 0} indicates whether to hold the position from (t+1) + lag until the next sell signal.
- A buy signal at time (t) leads to buying at the opening of (t+1), and a sell signal at time (t) leads to selling at the opening of (t+1).
